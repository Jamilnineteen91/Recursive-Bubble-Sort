# Recursive-Bubble-Sort
This code executes a recursive and non-recursive bubble sort. A comparison of each functions run time is initiated at the end.

Rules for recursion: 
  1. The algorithm must have a base case.
  2. The algorithm must change its state in order to get to the base case.
  3. The algorithm must call itself.
